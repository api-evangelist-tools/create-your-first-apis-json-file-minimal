title: Create Your First APIs.json File
---

<h3>Create Your First APIs.json File (minimum)</h3>
<p>This is a quick and dirty way to build you first <a href="http://apis.json.org/" target="_blank">APIs.json file</a>. Most likely you came across one of my tools that needed an APIs.json file to do something interesting with your OpenAPI Spec. All you need to create is add the URL for your OpenAPI Spec, and this will do the rest.</p>


<form method="get" action="add.php">
<h4>Minimum Information Needed</h4>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="api-openapi-spec-url">What is the URL for the OpenAPI Specification?</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="api-openapi-spec-url" name="api-openapi-spec-url" placeholder="http://example.com/openapi-spec.json">
  </div>
</form>
<button onclick="BuildAPIsJSON();" type="submit" class="btn btn-default" name="add-organization" value="1">Generate My APIs.json</button>
